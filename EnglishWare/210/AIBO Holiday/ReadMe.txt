DOWNLOADING INSTRUCTIONS:

To use this AIBO Treat, download the zip file (.ZIP) to your PC.

OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS:

Insert the Memory Stick and boot AIBO.  AIBO will stretch, and then

immediately, touch one of his sensors (head sensor, chin sensor or
back sensor).

AIBO does not stand up or walk with this software.   However, please
use care when positioning AIBO.
